The second round transitioned into a practical coding challenge, where I was asked to design a form-based UI using React.js in CodeSandbox. The problem statement included three tabs: Profile, Interest, and Settings, with specific field requirements like:
Age Field: Only numeric values allowed.
Email Field: Validation to ensure the correct format.
I had to incorporate dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, and implement:
Validation for mandatory fields.
Data persistence across tabs.
A Submit button that submitted the entire form only on the last tab.
This coding challenge not only tested my React knowledge but also led to a discussion on scalability and maintainability. The interviewer suggested creating a form configuration object to dynamically generate the form, sparking a discussion about:
Scalability: How easily the form could be extended or modified without rewriting significant portions of the code.
Maintainability: How modular, readable, and organized code is crucial for large teams and long-term projects.
